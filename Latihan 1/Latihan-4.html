        There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. <span class="red">The U.S. Bureau of
        Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is
        more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a
        software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S.
        workers.

        Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of
        software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often
        beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming
        can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming
        experience.

        The <u class="blue">Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u> at Northeastern University is
        specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another
        field of study.

            at Northeastern University—Seattle. "<i>We focus on math, programming, and a
